# Python-Snake
A game of snake I codded in python for fun

Just run the .py file, there are no additional files, it just needs python3 with numpy, random and pygame.

Move with arrow keys, echap for a pause and d to change game speed, but it's cheating.

You can manually change the game window size by changing line 54 in the script.
